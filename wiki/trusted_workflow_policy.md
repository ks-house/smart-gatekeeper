# Trusted workflow policy bootstrap

## 1. Trust boundary

`.github/workflows/trusted_workflow_policy.yml` uses `pull_request_target` without `paths` or `paths-ignore` filters to prevent required-check deadlocks, ensuring `Verify protected files against trusted base policy` runs on all pull requests targeting `main` (including docs-only PRs). It never checks out or executes pull-request code. The workflow checks out only the trusted `base.sha` with credentials disabled and sparse paths limited to the base validator and policy. Candidate protected files are downloaded from the candidate repository and commit through the GitHub Contents API, decoded as inert bytes, normalized, and hashed.

The job has only `contents: read`. Pull-request titles, branches, file contents, and other attacker-controlled values are never interpolated into an executable command. The candidate repository and 40-hex commit are passed as quoted environment variables and validated again by the base script.

## 2. Protected bundle decision

The machine-readable policy is `.github/workflow-policy/trusted_workflow_policy.json`; the base validator is
`scripts/verify_trusted_workflow_policy.py`. The policy protects these files as one indivisible bundle:

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- `.github/workflows/build_app.yml`
- `.github/workflows/ota_contract.yml`
- `scripts/ota_contract_gate.py`
- `ota/requirements.txt`

`utf8-lf-v1` means strict UTF-8 decoding followed only by CRLF/CR-to-LF conversion. No whitespace, comments,
keys, steps, action versions, commands, or trailing newlines are otherwise ignored. The normalized bytes use
SHA-256. A candidate passes only when every protected path exactly matches one complete approved bundle;
mixing individually approved files from different bundles is rejected.

The transition is complete. The policy contains exactly one `current-main-baseline` bundle sourced from
merged `main` at `cc977e42770e6d88822459436a770295632c6e45`. The temporary
`origin-main-bootstrap@8c36ead` and `pr-28-preapproved@7bae62f` entries are retired. PR #28's protected
bytes became the merged-main bytes, so their digest values are retained under the new main provenance;
the old bundle identities and old pre-PR #28 byte set are no longer approved.

## 3. Why PR self-modification does not authorize itself

A PR may show edits to the policy, validator, or workflow, but the running `pull_request_target` job comes
from the default branch and explicitly loads the policy and validator from the trusted base SHA. The base
validator fetches only the protected path list from that base policy. Candidate copies of the policy or
validator are never imported, parsed, or executed, so changing them cannot change the decision for that PR.

Changes to these trust-control files still require an explicit security review before merge because their
effect begins only after they become default-branch code.

## 4. Rotation procedure

The PR #28 transition used two steps: first merge the independently reviewed protected bytes through the
temporary approval, then rotate the policy in this separate policy-only change to the actual merged-main
commit. Future protected-file changes must follow the same separation: independently review an exact full
bundle, merge only through trusted-base authorization, then use a separate policy-only PR to remove any
temporary approval and pin one current-main baseline. Never add a wildcard, branch name, partial-file
exception, mixed bundle, or candidate-derived digest.

Issue #23 remains open and OTA-G1 through OTA-G4 physical/operator evidence remains pending throughout any
policy rotation.

## 5. Scope and OTA status

This policy adds a repository authorization boundary only. It does not change the authenticated mobile
`manual_remote` door-open path, firmware/app runtime code, dual OTA partitions, health/rollback, periodic
HTTPS, authenticated local recovery, mobile updater independence, N/N-1 compatibility, signing trust, or
artifact verification. No physical OTA evidence is claimed.
